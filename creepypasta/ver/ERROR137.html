        <p class="history">Minecraft Alpha 1.2.3_06 is the Seecret Saturday update version, which is due to be released on November 27, 2010. It fixes several errors in the update log. Since this is a seecret update, many unknown features have been added for players. Later, due to an error in the line of code, the game could not work properly, and it was replaced with 1.2.3_05. But this version was accidentally copied by a Mojang employee.
        <p class="history">The folder size of this version is slightly increased. A few days later, the employee was surprised to discover that the size of the version he had built a few years ago was actually growing on its own! The employee tried to open the game and found that the game could not be started. After correcting the error in the code, he started the game normally, and after playing for a while, he found that there were no deviations.</p>
